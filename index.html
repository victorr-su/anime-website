    <p> Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. The term anime is derived from the English word animation, and in Japan is used to refer to all forms of animated media.[5] Outside Japan, the term refers 
      specifically to animation from Japan or to a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.
       This culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan. Anime has surged in popoularity in North America, and is on par with many of the modern tv shows in terms of fanbase and views.
       This list is going to tell you in my <em>personal opinion</em>, the top 10 anime's that 
      were ever made. Be aware that this is just my personal opnion, and others may or may not agree with my decisions.
      Furthermore, there are three things that I am judging these anime's on.</p>

            <figcaption>The year is 2022, and gamers have lined up on launch day for Sword Art Online, a hotly-anticipated MMORPG that lets players connect to an immersive virtual reality world with special helmets called Nerve Gear. Kirito is one such gamer who's eager to jump back into action, 
              having spent a great deal of time as a beta tester, and quickly becomes friends with newbie warrior Klein. But soon, Sword Art Online's 10,000 players discover that not only are they unable to log out, the only way they can return to their physical bodies is by beating the 100-level tower's final boss 
              - death in the game means death in the real world. Now, with no one else to turn to, Kirito and the other participants must survive the game as best they can. This is a very unique anime and one of the first ones that I have ever watched, so I suggest you give it a try.

          <p> Release Date: April 7, 2013 <br> Director: Shinji Higuchi</p>
          <figcaption>Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit. "The Advancing Giant[s]") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. 
            It is set in a world where humanity lives within cities surrounded by enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to retake the world after a Titan brings about the destruction of his home town and the death of his mother. 
            Attack on Titan has been serialized in Kodansha's monthly Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine since September 2009, and collected into 31 tankōbon volumes as of April 2020. Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour 
            human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. This is a top tier anime that everyone has in their top 10.</figcaption>
